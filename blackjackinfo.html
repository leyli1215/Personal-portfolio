  <h2>Blackjack Game</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong> This Blackjack game simulates the classic casino card game, allowing the player to compete against the computer. The game handles card drawing, calculates hand values, and determines the winner based on standard Blackjack rules, with the player making decisions like hitting, standing, or doubling down.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The project was a beginner-level exercise that enhanced my understanding of game development principles and object-oriented programming. It provided a practical application for fundamental concepts such as loops and conditionals, while also teaching me about game logic and strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Implementing the game logic, such as managing aces as either 1 or 11, shuffling and dealing cards, and handling the player's input, was a significant challenge. Translating the complex rules of Blackjack into code required careful planning, debugging, and refinement to ensure smooth gameplay.</li>
      <li><strong>Solutions:</strong> I approached these challenges by breaking the game down into smaller components, creating separate classes for the deck, hand, and player. Methods were implemented to shuffle the deck, deal cards, and dynamically calculate hand values. Through testing and refinement, I developed a functional and enjoyable game.</li>
      <li><strong>Takeaways:</strong> Developing the Blackjack game reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts. It was a rewarding experience that strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and game logic, providing valuable lessons for future projects.</li>
