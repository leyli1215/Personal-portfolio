  <h2>Turkmen School Website</h2>
  <ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>I developed a website for Turkmen School that serves as a resource to share the school’s mission and provide contact information for interested individuals.</li>
          <li>I also integrated a chatbot system into the website, making it interactive and capable of answering user queries with context-driven responses.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The website improved accessibility to information about the organization, allowing more people to learn about its mission and connect with it effectively.</li>
          <li>The chatbot enhanced the user experience by providing quick and relevant answers to questions, making the website more engaging and useful.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the main challenges I faced was learning website development from scratch, which involved understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Implementing OpenAI’s Embedding API and ChatGPT API for the chatbot system was also challenging, as it required grasping complex concepts and processes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Solutions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>I addressed the challenges by engaging in self-guided learning and exploring various resources to understand web development tools and programming languages.</li>
          <li>I broke down content into smaller chunks and used OpenAI’s Embedding API to create numerical embeddings that captured the meaning of the text.</li>
          <li>Through testing and iterative development, I refined the chatbot system to ensure its responses were accurate and relevant to user queries.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Takeaways:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>This project taught me the importance of self-learning and adaptability when tackling new challenges, especially in technology.</li>
          <li>It also reinforced the value of combining creativity with technical skills to develop practical, user-focused solutions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
