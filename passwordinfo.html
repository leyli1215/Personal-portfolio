  <h2>Password Generator</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong> I developed a password generator that creates a random password based on a specified number of letters and numbers provided by the user. The program prompts the user to input the desired quantity of each character type and then generates a randomized, secure password accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The project serves as a practical tool for users who struggle with creating secure passwords. Many people face challenges in meeting password requirements, such as length and complexity, which are essential for protecting their data from hacking threats. By using this generator, users can effortlessly create strong passwords that meet security standards, enhancing their online safety.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the primary challenges I encountered was implementing input validation to ensure users couldn't input unreasonable values. I had to design restrictions that allowed flexibility while preventing potential errors. Another challenge was managing the balance between randomness and user-defined criteria to ensure both security and usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Solutions:</strong> I leveraged a series of <code>if</code> statements to enforce input validation and ensure the generated passwords met security standards. By applying these logical checks, I balanced randomness with user-defined criteria, enhancing both the reliability and security of the password generator. This approach streamlined the program while maintaining its effectiveness, making it a powerful tool for everyday use.</li>
      <li><strong>Takeaways:</strong> This project was significant as it was one of my first self-taught endeavors and a step beyond creating simple games. It allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in Python and understand the practical application of user input handling in programming. I was proud to see my skills translate into a functional tool that could be useful in everyday situations.</li>
