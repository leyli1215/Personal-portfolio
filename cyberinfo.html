  <h2>Cybersecurity Awareness Website</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong> The first challenge that I participated in Junior Academy was a cyber security challenge. Working with my team members, I designed a website using Wix to educate users about cybersecurity threats and promote best practices. The site features educational videos and interactive content to inform users about potential risks associated with online activities, such as account creation and the use of VPNs. The goal was to enhance user awareness and understanding of cybersecurity issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The website aimed to bridge the gap in user knowledge regarding online security risks by integrating psychological insights with technology. This approach provided a unique and effective method to make users more conscious of cybersecurity threats, helping them make informed decisions and better protect their personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Creating engaging content for a diverse audience, including both children and adults, was a major challenge. Designing the site to cater to different age groups and levels of understanding required balancing educational value with interactive elements to maintain user interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Solutions:</strong> Adopted a user-centered design approach by developing age-appropriate content and interactive features tailored to various learning styles. Implemented engaging elements, such as quizzes and visual aids, to make the information accessible and appealing to users of all ages.</li>
      <li><strong>Takeaways:</strong> Gained practical experience in website design using Wix and learned how to effectively communicate complex topics through interactive and engaging content. The project highlighted the importance of considering the audience's perspective and integrating psychological principles with technological solutions to enhance user engagement and education.</li>
