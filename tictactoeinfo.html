  <h2>Tic Tac Toe Game</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Function:</strong> I created a Tic Tac Toe game where two players can compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Unlike versions that feature AI opponents, I designed this game to be shared with family and friends, offering a more personal and interactive experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This project allowed me to consolidate and apply my foundational Python skills in a practical way. By integrating loops and conditional statements, I was able to create a fully functional game. It served as an important step in my programming journey, turning abstract concepts into a real, shareable product.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to detect when a player had won the game by getting three in a row. With my limited knowledge at the time, I had to devise a method to effectively check for these winning conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Solutions:</strong> To solve the challenge of detecting winning combinations, I implemented an array that tracked all possible win states (rows, columns, and diagonals). I used loops to efficiently check these states after each move, ensuring the game could quickly determine a winner or continue play. This solution allowed me to effectively apply my understanding of arrays and loops, ensuring the game operated smoothly.</li>
      <li><strong>Takeaways:</strong> This project was a significant milestone as it was my first experience creating a complete game. It not only reinforced my Python skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle more complex projects in the future. Seeing a familiar game come to life through my own coding efforts was highly motivating and strengthened my passion for programming.</li>
